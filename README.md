To push Docker images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for your Go and Next.js applications, follow these steps. AWS account set up with permissions to access ECR.

1. Install AWS CLI
install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine. You can follow the official AWS CLI installation guide: Installing the AWS CLI

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
sudo apt install unzip
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install -i /usr/local/aws-cli -b /usr/local/bin --update

2. Configure AWS CLI
After installing the AWS CLI, configure it with your AWS credentials and region. Run the following command and follow the prompts:

aws configure

3. Create ECR Repositories
Before pushing images, you need to create repositories for your Go and Next.js applications in AWS ECR.

# Create ECR repository for Go application
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-app-backend

# Create ECR repository for Next.js application
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-app-frontend

4. Authenticate Docker with ECR
Before you can push Docker images to ECR, you need to authenticate Docker with your AWS ECR registry.

aws ecr get-login-password --region your-region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin your-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com

5.Tag Docker Images
Tag your Docker images with the ECR repository URLs.

docker tag yourdockerhubusername/go-app:latest your-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/my-app-backend:latest
docker tag yourdockerhubusername/nextjs-app:latest your-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/my-app-frontend:latest

6. Push Docker Images to ECR
Finally, push the tagged Docker images to AWS ECR.

docker push your-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/my-app-backend:latest
docker push your-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/my-app-frontend:latest

After pushing, you can verify the images in your AWS ECR repository console under the respective repository names (my-app-backend and my-app-frontend).

Adjust the commands and placeholders according to your AWS environment, account ID, region, and ECR repository names.

7. Docker Compose file:

The go-app service is built from the Dockerfile located in the ./go-app directory.
The nextjs-app service is built from the Dockerfile located in the ./nextjs-app directory.
Both services expose their respective ports (8080 for Go and 3000 for Next.js) to the host machine, allowing you to access them locally.
Make sure to adjust the paths (./go-app and ./nextjs-app) in the context field to point to the actual directories where your Go and Next.js applications are located. Additionally, ensure that your Dockerfiles for Go and Next.js are properly configured to build the applications within their respective contexts.

To use this Docker Compose file:

Place the Docker Compose file in the root directory of your project.
Create separate directories go-app and nextjs-app containing respective Dockerfiles and application code.
Run the following command to spin up the entire stack:

docker-compose up

Access your applications:
Go application: http://localhost:8080
Next.js application: http://localhost:3000
